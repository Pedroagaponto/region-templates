DataSpaces IB ver. 1.03beta
Usage:
make lib : 	create lib files
make test: 	create executables put and get test
		use qsub jobfiles/jobxx to run the test on sith
		remember to run make restart to remove conf. files after each run
		DataSpaces IB will run on 1024 cores (clients) with 8-16 staging servers
		I suggest to try a smaller test first to see how it goes.

Make test will create 3 executables: dataspaces_sever, test_get and test_put
The configuration of the "space" and be found in dataspaces.conf.
This  file should  be  editted  according to  the
specific  requirements for  DataSpaces  depend on how your applications.  The
configuration parameters are:
  ndim : number of  dimensions for the application data domain
  dimx : size of x dimension
  dimy : size of y dimension
  dimz : size of z  dimension
  max_versions :  the maximum  number of versions  (in iteration-based
                  simulations) of a data object stored in DataSpaces
  max_reader   :  the  maximum  number  of   concurrent  data  reading
                  applications in the workflow

For test_put and test_get, you should not have to change anything.

Depend on which queuing system you have, you can create your own job script.
The exampe job script is for mpirun.

The DataSpaces server executable has three command line options:

  --server, -s    number of server instance/staging nodes
  --cnodes, -c    number of compute nodes
  --conf, -f      path to the configuration file


The test application executables  "test_put" and "test_get" requires 8
arguments as arg1-arg8:

  arg1 : number of total application processes
  arg2 : number of processes in x direction (of the process layout)
  arg3 : number of processes in y direction (of the process layout)
  arg4 : number of processes in z direction (of the process layout)
  arg5 : block size per process in x direction (of the app data domain)
  arg6 : block size per process in y direction (of the app data domain)
  arg7 : block size per process in z direction (of the app data domain)
  arg8 : number of iterations
