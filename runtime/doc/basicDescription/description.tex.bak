\section{Motivation/Objective}

The successful introcution of accelerators as general purpose processors is
changing current High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which are nowadays
being deployed as heterogeneous CPU-GPU eqquiped platforms. Taking advantage of
those solution, however, still be a very hard programming tasks, mainly due to
the lack of high level programming languages, and runtime frameworks to
abstract the complex interactions on heterogeneous systems. While some work has
been done in order to execute simple kernel applications using CPU and GPUs
cooperatively, including MapReduce computations in shared memory
machines~\cite{mars,merge,qilin09luk}, the execution of more complex pipelined
applications (eg. with dependency among stages) in distributed environments
still a challenging open problem. The intention of this work is to propose and
implement runtime support to make easier or viable the deployment of real
complex applications on distributed environments. To accomplish this tasks we
will automage/hide from the user most of the complex interactions of the
application with the executing plataform, providing a set of non-trivial
optimizations/scheduling decisions.
